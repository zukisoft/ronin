        "ruling": "- [[The End of Anubis]] WILL negate the effects of [[Night Assailant]] (its second effect), [[Aswan Apparition]], [[Nubian Guard]], [[Sangan]], [[Witch of the Black Forest]] (even if Tributed to Tribute Summon [[The End of Anubis]]), [[Mystic Tomato]]/[[Giant Rat]]/etc., [[Sinister Serpent]], [[Magician of Faith]], [[Dark Magician of Chaos]]' spell retrieval effect, [[Vampire Lord]]'s ability to return from the Graveyard, [[Dark Necrofear]]'s ability to return from the Graveyard, and activation of [[Call of the Haunted]] or [[Premature Burial]].[[The End of Anubis]] WILL NOT negate the Special Summon of [[Chaos Emperor Dragon - Envoy of the End]], [[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning]], [[Dark Necrofear]], [[Soul of Purity and Light]], etc. (because these involve costs, not effects, and [[The End of Anubis]] cannot negate paying costs). [[The End of Anubis]] WILL NOT negate [[Strike Ninja]]'s effect because removing 2 DARK monsters from the Graveyard is a cost.[[The End of Anubis]] WILL NOT negate Ignition Effects unless it requires the monster to be in the Graveyard when the Ignition Effect is activated (such as \"Amazoness Chain-Master\").[[The End of Anubis]] WILL NOT negate the effect of [[Fiend Comedian]], [[Fiber Jar]], or [[Big Burn]].You can chain [[Call of the Haunted]] to your opponent's effect that targets a card in the Graveyard or activates in the Graveyard to Special Summon [[The End of Anubis]] and negate that effect.[[The End of Anubis]] negates the Special Summon effect of [[Premature Burial]] & [[Call of the Haunted]], but does not negate the effect that destroys the monster when [[Premature Burial]]/[[Call of the Haunted]] is destroyed.While [[The End of Anubis]] is on the field, if you Special Summon [[Gilasaurus]], your opponent can't Special Summon.If [[The End of Anubis]] is face-up on the field when a flipped [[Spear Cretin]] is sent to the Graveyard, then [[Spear Cretin]]'s effect does not activate. But if [[The End of Anubis]] was merely on the field when [[Spear Cretin]] was flipped, but is NOT on the field when [[Spear Cretin]] is sent to the Graveyard, then [[Spear Cretin]]'s effect DOES activate when sent to the Graveyard because [[The End of Anubis]] is no longer on the field to negate it.When [[Night Assailant]] is discarded to activate the effect of [[Tribe-Infecting Virus]], and Fiend is named, the effect of [[Night Assailant]] is activated after [[Tribe-Infecting Virus]] resolves because [[The End of Anubis]] is no longer on the field.You cannot send [[Desrook Archfiend]] to the Graveyard for its effect while [[The End of Anubis]] is on the field, because the effect of [[Desrook Archfiend]] targets the destroyed [[Terrorking Archfiend]] in the Graveyard."
