So if you Tribute [[Pinch Hopper]] for a Tribute Summon, you cannot activate the effect of [[Pinch Hopper]] because the last thing to happen will be the Summoning of the Tribute monster. Also, if you Tribute [[Pinch Hopper]] for [[Cannon Soldier]], the very last thing that happened will be the 500 points of damage inflicted to your opponent, so the effect of [[Pinch Hopper]] will not activate."
