If your opponent chains a card to destroy the target of [[Dust Tornado]], you cannot then Set a Spell or Trap Card because [[Dust Tornado]] did not destroy a Spell or Trap Card. If your opponent activates the card targeted by [[Dust Tornado]] it is not negated, but is still destroyed by [[Dust Tornado]] so you may Set one Spell or Trap Card."
