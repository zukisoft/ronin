All it does is prevent \"Horus the Black Flame Dragon\" from being selected as a target. If your opponent selects \"Horus the Black Flame Dragon\" as a target (with [[Ring of Destruction]], for example), and you chain [[Call of the Haunted]] to Special Summon [[Horus' Servant]], then \"Horus the Black Flame Dragon\" will still be destroyed by [[Ring of Destruction]] because [[Horus' Servant]] is being Special Summoned AFTER \"Horus the Black Flame Dragon\" was selected. The fact that [[Ring of Destruction]] has not yet resolved does not matter; \"Horus the Black Flame Dragon\" was selected at activation of [[Ring of Destruction]], and [[Horus' Servant]] is Special Summoned too late to prevent this."
