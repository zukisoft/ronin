So if you Tributed [[Batteryman D]], the opponent may activate [[Trap Hole]] as a chain to the effect of [[Super-Electromagnetic Voltech Dragon]] and destroy [[Super-Electromagnetic Voltech Dragon]] before it can negate the effects of Spell & Trap Cards that target it. (In other words, by chaining to the effect that would give [[Super-Electromagnetic Voltech Dragon]] immunity, you can destroy it before it becomes immune.)"
