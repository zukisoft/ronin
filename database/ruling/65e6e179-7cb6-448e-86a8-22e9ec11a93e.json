The first way is with a Spell Card like [[Monster Reborn]], a Trap Card like [[Call of the Haunted]], or an Effect Monster like [[Magical Scientist]]. The second way is built in to the monster, and Special Summons it without activating an effect, such as [[Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning]] or [[Dark Necrofear]]. [[Royal Oppression]] can negate both of these types of Special Summon. In the first case, you chain the activation of [[Royal Oppression]]'s effect to the activation of the Spell, Trap, or Monster Card's effect, and negate the effect. In the second case, right before the monster is Special Summoned, you can activate the effect of [[Royal Oppression]] to negate the Special Summon (the same procedure that you use for [[Horn of Heaven]] or [[Solemn Judgment]])."
