You can Special Summon this card from your hand (but Tributes are required if it is Level 5 or higher). This card cannot attack during the turn it is Summoned. This card cannot attack unless you pay 500 Life Points. When \"Toon World\" is destroyed, destroy this card. If your opponent doesn't control a Toon Monster, this card can attack your opponent directly. If your opponent controls a face-up Toon Monster, you must select it as an attack target."
