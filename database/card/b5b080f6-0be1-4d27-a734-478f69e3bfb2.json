    "text": "This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. This card can only be Special Summoned while \"Toon World\" is on your side of the field. You can Special Summon this monster from your hand, but Tributes are required for monsters level 5 or more. When \"Toon World\" on the field is destroyed, this card is also destroyed. If your opponent doesn't control a Toon Monster, this card can attack your opponent directly. If a face-up Toon Monster is on your opponent's side of the field, you must select the Toon Monster as an attack target. This card gains 300 ATK for each \"Dark Magician\" or \"Magician of Black Chaos\" in either player's Graveyard."
