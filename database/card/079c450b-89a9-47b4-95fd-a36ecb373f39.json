When your opponent draws this card, it is Special Summoned on your opponent's side of the field in face-up Defense Position and inflicts 1000 points of damage to your opponent's Life Points. Then all face-up monsters on your opponent's side of the field become Insect-Type as long as this card remains face-up on the field."
